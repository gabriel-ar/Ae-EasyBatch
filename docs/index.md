# {EXT NAME}
The After Effects template automator.

Batch render a template in After Effects, given data in form of a table.

### Simple Use Case
You have a lower third template, with two customizable fields, *Top Text* and *Bottom Text*. With our extension, you could load a `.csv` table file with colums named *'Top Text'* and *'Bottom Text'*, coontaining hundreds of rows. The extension allows you to create a render per row. For the file names of the renders, you can decide on a pattern. The extension could use the text in `Top Text` or `Bottom Tex` to name the file, or  you can create a custom increment.
