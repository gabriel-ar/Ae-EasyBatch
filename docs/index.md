# Templator
The After Effects template automator.

This extension allows you to make better use of your Motion Graphics templates and create data driven batch renders.

Lets say you have a lower third template, with two customizable fields, Top Text and Bottom Text. With our extension, you could load a `.csv` file with colums named 'Top Text' and 'Bottom Text', matching with hundreds of rows of data and create a render for each row. Then, to save the files, you can decide a pattern where it creates the file name with the vales of Top Text and Bottom Text, that way making every file unique and easy to find.
