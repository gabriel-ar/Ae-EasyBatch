# EasyBatch
### Data to Renders in After Effects.

The extension automates the rendering of Motion Graphics Templates.
Use a .csv file or input the data in the extension. Render one composition or many for each line of data. Streamline versioning of templates.

For tutorials and the user guide, see [the documentation.](https://gabriel-ar.github.io/Ae-EasyBatch/)

## Development 
The UI uses Svelte, vanilla css and Radix icons. To interface with After Effects, Adobe's ExtendScript.

### To start development:
Use VS Code with the ExtendScript extension (only debugger maintained by Adobe).

- Clone the repository.
- Install the ExtendScript extension in VS Code.
- Run npm install to install the necessary packages.

- Set up your After Effects software for development (read the full guide [here](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_12.x/Documentation/CEP%2012%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md))
    - MAC: Use the `debug_config.sh` script
    - WIN: Use `debug_config.bat`
- Create a symlink in the [folder](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_12.x/Documentation/Debugging%20Handbook.md) where After Effects searches for extensions, pointing to your development `dist` folder. That way no copy is necessary on every build.
- Modify the MainPath property of `CSXS\manifest.xml` depending on whether you're going to develop or distribute. This is the property that tells the Adobe CEP interpreter what file renders the UI of the extension.
    - For development, MainPath should point to `dev.html`. This file only contains a redirect to `localhost:5173` where we develop with hot reload using Vite/Svelte.
    - For packaging, change MainPath to `index.html`. This is the file generated by Vite/Svelte `npm_build` task. 
    **Important:** Since Ae uses [CEF](https://github.com/chromiumembedded) to render the extension, and it is opening it as a local file on the disk, we are subjected to Chrome's security rules. These prevents the `file://` protocol from loading modules. For this reason, we use the `vite-plugin-singlefile` in order to avoid loading files.

### Debugging
After you have changed the `MainPath` property in the manifest as suggested above, use the predefined VS Code tasks. In the VS Code command palette type `task` and select a task.
    
- **npm_dev:** It runs `vite`. This starts `localhost:5173` with vite's live update. Since we setup the extension to redirect to this address, our extension will update as we save files (except for ExtendScript files, where the extension needs to be reloaded). To debug the CEF rendering the html inside After Effects, see `.debug File` below.
- **npm_build:** It runs `vite build`:
    - It creates the extension's entry point `index.html` inside `dist`.
    - Using `viteSingleFile` packages the JS modules and the CSS inside the html file.
    - Using `viteStaticCopy` it copies the files inside the `CSXS` and `host` folders to the `dist` folder.

#### .debug File
This file will indicate the Adobe application to start a CEF debug session using the port described in it. In this case we're using `8009`. Therefore, by opening `http://localhost:8009/` you can debug the CEF host rendering the extension. The `.debug` file has to be located inside the `dist` folder, and the ID of the extension, has to match the ID declared in the `manifest.xml`.

### Important Files
#### CSXS/manifest.xml
This is the document that defines our extension. After Effects will scan the extensions folder and will recognize an extension by looking for any folder that contains `CSXS/manifest.xml`.

#### src/
Svelte source files. Mainly the files that have to do with UI/User Interaction.

- **App.svelte** Main entry point for our app.
- **lib/Messaging.mjs** Defines classes for communication between the UI and the CEP/ExtendScript side.
- **lib/AutomatorTypes** Contains the classes where the app stores its data.
- **lib: PropInput, ModalAlternate, Dropdown** Svelte UI components.

#### host/index.js
This is the ExtendScript side of our app. ExtendScript is based on ECMAScript 3 and is the language used by scripts to interact with Adobe applications. Our Svelte application can't access directly the methods of ExtendScript. For that, we need to call `__adobe_cep__.evalScript()`.
